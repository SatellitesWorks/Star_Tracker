# Star Tracker <br />

## Overview

This GitHub contains the Star Tracker (ST) development for SUCHAI 2 - 3. 
SUCHAI-1 is the first NanoSatellite developed by Universidad de Chile, at the 
Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory (SPEL). Launched on June 23 (2017), 
the satellite is currently operational. Actually, we are working on two more NanoSatellites, the SUCHAI 2 & 3. <br />
[More info about the SUCHAI proyect.](http://spel.ing.uchile.cl)

## Description

- This is a fully functional Star Tracker that you can try on a Linux PC. Nevertheless, the main idea is to use it with a Raspberry Pi and its camera in an autonomously way. <br />
- This code is written in _Python 2.7_. All the code and the necessary files are in the __RPI__ folder. <br />
- This Git-Hub is __free__ and __open__ to everyone interested in using it, __especially researchers working on CubeSats!__. <br />

## Installation instructions

1. This ST code is based on two open softwares commonly used in Astronomy: __Source Extractor__ and __Match__. To use this ST program, you need to install this two software first.<br />
    1.1.- Get and install [Source Extractor.](https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) 
You can find this program in the Linux (RPI) repository, and install it by typing in terminal: <br />
        _sudo apt-get install sextractor_ <br />
We use __version 2.19.5__ in our program. <br />
    1.2.- Get and install [Match](http://spiff.rit.edu/match/). We use __version 0.14__ in our program. <br />

2. This ST program uses the [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) package. You can install it by tiping in terminal: <br />
        _pip install astropy_ <br />
 
3. Finally, clone this repository in any folder on your RPI, for example: __/home/pi/Desktop/Git/ST/__

## Instructions for use

### To use it with Raspberry Pi pictures

1. For a 10 degrees catalog separation, run in _Python_ the file _StarTracker_10_deg.py_. By default, 
it will use a picture from __/RPI/Sample_Images/__. Also, you can test it with other pictures, or use your own pictures taked with your RPI Camera.

2. For a 5 degrees catalog separation, run in _Python_ the file _StarTracker_5_deg.py_.

### To use it with STEREO pictures
